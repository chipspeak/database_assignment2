$match for non-null directors and cast. $unwind is used to create a new document from the directors array for each individual element.
$addFields is used to create a new field directorInCast which will be set to true if the director also appears in the cast array in addition an average of imdb ratings
$match is used again to check for when directorInCast is true meaning the director appears in the films cast
$group is then used to group the documents by directors and totalFilms is calculated using $sum on the documents of each group
$min and $max are also used on the year fields for use in displaying the earliest and latest film from the list
$project is used to format the display to id, totalfilms, earliest and latest before sorting by totalFilms in which they direct and appear

//2. --- Genres that Cersei Lannister comments on most and their average Rotten Tomatoes Rating
/*
$match is used to match the name field with Cersei Lannister. The comments document is unwound creating a new document for each comment.
$match is used again on the unwound document to match the name before genres is unwound creating a document for each genre on which the comments appear.
Worth noting that this may slightly alter finds as it's counting comments on multi-genred films as separate i.e "War, Romance" will both receive individual entries
Thus counting as two separate genres receiving comment rather than joined. This is purely for the tidiness of aesthetics.
$group is then used to group documents by genre before $sum is used to count the number of documents (and therefore the amount of comments i.e commentCount)
Additionally averageTomatoesRating is declared as the $avg of the tomatoes ratings on the documents
$project is then used to format the output. As opposed to the above aggregate, in this one id is left off the output and $round is used limit the average to 1 decimal place.
